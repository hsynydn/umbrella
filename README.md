*Umbrella* is an experiment-demonstration repository.

For now it includes a library (a very simple one) source code.  
You can see the creation of static and shared version of that  
library and also can see the linking of both versions.

Under klogger directory there will be a linux kernel module  
which listens keystrokes and then saves into a database.

Future is little hazy to say what will get under Umbrella.
