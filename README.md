*Umbrella* is an experiment-demonstration repository.

For now it includes a library (a very simple one) source code.  
You can see the creation of static and shared version of that  
library and also can see the linking of both versions.

Under _klogger_ directory there will be a linux kernel module  
which listens keystrokes and then saves into a database.

Future is little hazy to say what will get under Umbrella.
